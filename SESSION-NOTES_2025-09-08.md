# Session Summary — 2025‑09‑08

This note captures the exact server‑visible state, findings, and the next actions to resume quickly tomorrow.

## What’s Live (confirmed on server)
- Loader stabilized: `Star_Map_Generator.html` uses the Google Maps script WITHOUT `loading=async` and WITH the callback `initializeGoogleMapInternal`.
- Auto‑load gate: `js/settings-auto-load.js` defers auto ZIP/address geocode until Maps is ready; otherwise it queues the request for map.js to drain.
- Map diagnostics: `js/map.js` draws a viewport rectangle + polygon immediately (map: map), prints a conspicuous blue status line, and includes diagnostics.
  - Status shows: ZIP, overlays state, point count, and `mapEq` (overlay map === live map). Corners are recorded.

## Observations from today’s tests
- Chrome (e.g., 29485, 33709): Status = `rect=on, poly=on, points=5; mapEq=true`, but no visible boundary or markers.
- Firefox (e.g., UK NP12 1QP): Status printed huge/incorrect corners; country showed as United States — indicating the old country restriction was skewing the viewport selection.
- Diagnostics confirm overlays are being created and attached to the live map. The remaining issue is a late map action erasing/hiding the overlay or a bad viewport when a country restriction is present.

## Root Causes Identified
1) Country restriction (componentRestrictions) was incorrect for non‑US (textual names instead of ISO‑3166 alpha‑2) and was not part of your original working flow. It can produce wrong viewports and mismatched results.
2) A late geocode/fit path can still run shortly after ZIP draw (e.g., address recenter or settings), effectively removing the visible overlay.

## What I changed today (workspace)
- Status component: conspicuous blue notice + diagnostics; ZIP included; corner list stored; temporary 5s corner markers added.
- Place extraction: for ZIP geocode, city/state/country are extracted from the matched result and saved for the notice message.
- Timestamps: Added confirmation lines at the top of the three edited files so you can verify uploads quickly.

## Plan — Step 1 (first task tomorrow)
- Restore your original working flow for visibility and stability:
  1) Remove `componentRestrictions` and stop reading the country selector in the ZIP geocode path (simple `geocode({ address: zip })`). Keep loader readiness queue only.
  2) Freeze overlays after ZIP draw: record a timestamp and ignore/delay any address geocode for ~1s; do not clear overlays from address geocode.
  3) Keep the rectangle + polygon + 5s corner markers so you SEE the shape on both Chrome and Firefox.
- Deliverable: single file (`js/map.js`) with a verified backup; then you CMU once.

## Next (after polygon is visibly stable)
- Remove the country selector entirely and keep the simple ZIP → viewport → polygon flow.
- Restore Date/Time display (blocker for image outputs) and ensure it renders on load and updates on change.
- Unify history saving: for US/UK/CA/AU, save "ZIP (City, Country/State)" consistently.
- Add country center presets you provided (UK, CA, AU) with an auto fit so nothing clips (USA remains as‑is).
- Remove temporary diagnostics/markers (we’ll keep the durable Notice component and improve its phrasing).

## Request to resume
- I will push the Step‑1 `js/map.js` patch first thing and send you the one‑file CMU list.
- After you upload, please test one US ZIP and one UK postcode, then paste the exact Notice line again.
