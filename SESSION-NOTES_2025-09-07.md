# Session Summary – ZIP Boundaries, Autofill, Init/Final Fixes
Date: 2025‑09‑07

This file is created per your Rule #11 so you can resume quickly tomorrow.

## What We Changed Today

- Map init reliability:
  - Added a safe Maps callback stub in `Star_Map_Generator.html` and registered the real initializer from `js/map.js`.
- ZIP/Postal boundaries path:
  - Client: `js/map.js` and `js/zip_boundary_patch.js` now build an absolute URL to `proxy/zip_polygon.php` and include `lat`/`lng` so the server can fall back.
  - Server: `proxy/zip_polygon.php` now uses cURL + multiple Overpass mirrors and, if none succeeds or no polygon exists, returns a rectangle Feature around the provided lat/lng (never just fails when lat/lng provided).
- History reliability during testing:
  - `js/history_fallback_shim.js` seeds from `history/data/*.json` and uses localStorage if the server 404s.
- “Creeping message” reduction:
  - `js/final-comprehensive-fixes.js` now runs once (guarded) and logs only when the formatted date actually changes (no periodic spam loop).
- Autofill suppression:
  - `js/autofill-suppress.js` sets autocomplete=off, randomizes the `name`, converts Address to type=search, and uses a readonly‑until‑interaction shim to block Chrome’s black autofill bubble.
- CSS:
  - `css/master-override.css` enforces compact width for the country selector.

Backups (created before edits) exist alongside each changed file with `_bak_YYYYMMDD_HHMM_SS` names.

## Current Observations (After Your CMU)

- Boundaries: You did not see a Network call to `/star-map/proxy/zip_polygon.php?...` yet; the UI shows the rectangle fallback only.
- Autofill: Chrome’s address autofill bubble still appears briefly then clears (readonly shim kicks in after interaction).
- Final fixes: Logs still visible for date updates; with the latest patch they should only appear on actual value changes.

## Quick Debug Checklist (Tomorrow)

1) Verify polygon fetch fires
   - Console: `window.DEBUG_POLY = true`
   - Then: type a ZIP and press Enter in the ZIP field, or run `geocodeZip('33709')` manually.
   - Expect a console line: `DEBUG_POLY: fetching polygon …/proxy/zip_polygon.php?postalcode=…&country=…&lat=…&lng=…`
   - If you do not see this log:
     - Confirm `typeof geocodeZip` prints `function`.
     - Confirm `js/map.js` is the new version (Add a one‑off `console.log('map.js loaded vTOMORROW')` if needed).

2) Verify proxy fallback works directly
   - Open in browser (replace lat/lng):
     - `https://anythingpod.com/star-map/proxy/zip_polygon.php?postalcode=33709&country=US&lat=27.82&lng=-82.74`
   - Expected: A GeoJSON `Feature` Polygon. If Overpass has no polygon, the response source will be `"fallback-rectangle"`.
   - If this returns error, check `proxy/php_errorlog` and share the last lines.

3) Autofill overlay still blocking ‘x’ delete?
   - The readonly shim prevents most cases, but Chrome may briefly show suggestions on first focus. Two stronger options for tomorrow:
     - Honeypot inputs: insert hidden dummy fields named like address lines to satisfy Chrome’s autofill, keeping the visible field clean.
     - Convert Address to a contenteditable shim or split into two fields (Chrome rarely autofills custom contenteditable controls).
   - I can implement either approach; recommend the honeypot first (minimal UI impact).

## Files You Already CMU’d (Today)

- `Star_Map_Generator.html`
- `js/map.js`
- `js/zip_boundary_patch.js`
- `js/autofill-suppress.js`
- `js/final-comprehensive-fixes.js`
- `js/history_fallback_shim.js`
- `css/master-override.css`
- `proxy/zip_polygon.php`  (and `proxy/cache/zip/` exists, perms 755)

## Proposed Plan for Tomorrow

1) Ensure polygon fetch triggers on ZIP entry (fix any remaining event wiring if needed).
2) If Google boundary API is available under your key, add it as tier‑1 in `zip_polygon.php` (you confirm endpoint/key), with Overpass as tier‑2.
3) Implement “honeypot” autofill fields ahead of visible inputs to fully stop the Chrome bubble.
4) Add a small “Polygon status” toast near the map (shows Rectangle Fallback vs Overpass vs Google) for quicker manual testing.

## Notes

- If caching still interferes, I will add cache‑busting query params to the changed JS/CSS in the HTML script/link tags.
- Rectangle fallback is guaranteed from the proxy when lat/lng is provided; the client should always see a Feature even when OSM lacks a ZIP polygon.

— End of notes. Resume here next session.
