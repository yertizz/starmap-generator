NOTE: *** UPDATED 04212025-19:48 

NOMENCLATURE USED:
*** !!! MEANS "COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY"
*** DFF MEANS "DEFERRED TASK"

================================================================================================================================================
!!! A. ADD THE STARMAP STYLE, CIRCLE RAIUS, BORDER WIDTH AND BORDER COLOR TO THE SAVE AND LOAD HISTORY SETTINGS
!!! B. THE 3 CUSTOMIZABLE TEXT ENTRIES AND THE DATE AND LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE COORDINATES ARE NOT BEING COPIED/GHOSTED INTO THE TEXT ENTRIES IN THE FIELDSET ORDER SECTION. DO THIS.
!!! C. ADD THE VALUES/SETTINGS OF THE "Text Placements On Canvas" SECTION EACH ONE TO THE HISTORY AND SAVE AND LOAD FUNCTIONS NAMELY: - SEE b ABOVE - ADD THE ORDER, ABOVE, AND BELOW MAP SETTINGS TO THE HISTORY AND LOAD AND SAVE FUNCTIONS
!!! D. DEFAULT THE %AGE CIRCLE RADIUS TO 60%
!!! E. MAKE SCROLLER AND DECORATIVE ARROWS SLIGHTLY LARGER SO YOU CAN DISCRIMINATE AND CLICK ON WITH EASE. THEY ARE TOO SMALL RIGHT NOW.

F. DFF:
ON LOADNG THE PAGE, I HAVE TO "HARD" REFRESSH THE PAGE "3" TIMES "EVERY" TIME THE PAGE IS HARD REFRESHED BEFORE THE GOOGLE MAP SHOWS. INVESTIGATE THIS AS THERE ARE ALSO WARNINGS IN ALL THE LOGS I HAVE BEEN SENDING YOU.

G. DFF:
THE STAR MAP IMAGE TAKES 15-20 SECONDS TO LOAD AND SOMETIMES IT TIMES OUT WITH AN END POINT NOT RECEIVED? INVESTIGATE

TASK H: DFF:
THE STAR IMAGE IS STILL ELLIPTICAL IN ITS SEMI-MAJOR AXIS... I AM A GEODESCIST  SO I KNOW THE SCIENCE OF EARTH'S SHAPE. IT IS AN OBLATE SPHEROID WITH A SEMI=MAJOR (EAST WEST) AND SEMI MINOR (NORTH SOUTH AXIS) AND A FLATTENING RATIO/ECCENTRICIY PARAMETER TO DEFINE THE OBLATE SPHEROID OF THE EARTH.

*** DEFINITION OF THE WGS84 REFERENCE RLLIPSOID (USE BY THE GLOBAL POSITOINING SYSTEM ABD THE USA MILITARY AND CIVILIANS ALIKE WORLD WIDE - NAMELY THE GPS POSITIONING SYSTEMS/DEVICES):

READ: Description
E = wgs84Ellipsoid creates a referenceEllipsoid object for the World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS84) reference ellipsoid. By default, the lengths of the semimajor axis and semiminor axis are in meters.

Example: 
E = wgs84Ellipsoid(lengthUnit) creates a WGS84 reference ellipsoid with the length unit specified by lengthUnit.

THIS MAY ASSIST YOU IN YOUR MATH OF OBTAINING THE CORRECT ECCENTRICITY OR "FLATTENING' RAIO OF THE EARTH BY SCIENCE

GENERATING SMAL CIRCLES - EXAMPLES:
https://www.mathworks.com/help/map/generate-small-circles.html 
EG: Generate Small Circles
A small circle is the intersection of a plane with the surface of a sphere, such as a parallel of latitude on a spherical representation of the Earth. You can generate a small circle from the center point and a point on the perimeter by using the scircle2 function. You can generate a small circle from the center point and the arc length of the radius by using the scircle1 function.

For this example, create a small circle that surrounds Norway, Sweden, and Finland by using the scircle2 function and then create an identical small circle by using the scircle1 function.
First, specify the coordinates of a center point and a point along the perimeter. Find the coordinates of 100 points that make up the small circle by using the scircle2 function.

ACKNOWLEDGE:


TASK H:
ALL HISTORY/SETTINGS TO BE WRITTEN TO A FILE IN NEW "HISTORY" FOLDER

TASK I:
ADVANCED STAR MAP FEATURES CAPABILITY WITH THE CURRENT STAR MAP API?
INVESTIGATE WHAT "ADVANCED OPTIONS" ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE USER TO ENHANCE THE AESTHETICS OR FEATURES ULTIMATELY DISPLAYED IN THE STARMAP IMAGE AND ENSURE THE "ADVANCED OPTIONS" FIELDSET IS MODIFIED TO ACCOMMODATE ANY NECESSARY UI.
