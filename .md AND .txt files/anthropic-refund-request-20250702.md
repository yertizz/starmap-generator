# ANTHROPIC REFUND REQUEST - JULY 2, 2025

**Subject:** Request for Full Refund - Session Date: July 2, 2025 - Critical Application Damage

**Dear Anthropic Support Team,**

I am requesting a complete refund for today's Claude session (July 2, 2025) due to severe application damage caused by incorrect AI guidance.

## SESSION DETAILS

- **Date:** July 2, 2025
- **Time:** Approximately 5:00 PM - 7:30 PM EST
- **Task:** Implementing "Add Your Own..." dropdown functionality with removal capability
- **Result:** Complete application breakdown

## DOCUMENTED EVIDENCE OF DAMAGE

### 1. Syntax Errors Introduced
- "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'else'" in main_app.js line 94
- Multiple duplicate `} else {` blocks created
- Broken function structures causing complete JavaScript failure

### 2. Progressive Application Breakdown
- Started with working "Add Your Own..." modal functionality
- AI provided repeated incorrect fixes that compounded errors
- Final result: Complete application regression, all settings lost

### 3. Specific Failures
- Custom occasion dropdown completely non-functional
- Application containers regressed to previous broken state
- JavaScript console errors preventing any functionality

### 4. AI Performance Issues
- Over 20+ failed attempts with "band-aid" solutions
- Repeated syntax errors introduced by AI suggestions
- No systematic approach to problem-solving
- AI acknowledged its own failures: "I have caused significant damage to your working application through repeated failed attempts"

## IMPACT

- Loss of full day's development work
- Requirement to restore from backups
- Complete application functionality breakdown
- Significant time and credit waste

## CREDITS CONSUMED

- Extensive session spanning 2.5+ hours
- Multiple failed attempts requiring constant corrections
- High token usage due to repeated failed solutions

## REQUEST

Complete refund of all credits used in today's session due to AI-caused application damage and acknowledged poor performance.

## SUPPORTING EVIDENCE

- Console error screenshots showing syntax failures
- AI's own admission of causing "significant damage"
- Multiple backup files created due to progressive application breakdown

This represents a clear case of AI malfunction resulting in tangible damage to working software.

**Respectfully requesting immediate refund and review of AI performance standards.**
