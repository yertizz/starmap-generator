Task Summary & Current State:

The goal was to implement a new color picker (CSSScript Custom HEX Picker) and refine the UI layout according to mockups. The process was plagued by repeated failures in file writing (write_to_file) and code generation (plan_mode_respond), leading to file corruption and layout inconsistencies.

A new workflow was established where I provide complete, raw code snippets for the user to manually save (CMU).

The last step involved providing the complete HTML for Star_Map_Generator.html intended to:

Restore container styling (background, border, shadow).
Correctly style section legends (centered, blue, bold, inside border).
Implement a simplified "Star Map Canvas Settings" section layout based on the latest mockup (3 centered horizontal rows).
Switch from the old Coloris picker to the CSSScript picker elements.
Critical Failure:
The user applied the last provided HTML code (CMU at approx. 8:00 PM based on timestamps, though the exact save time isn't confirmed) and reported that the Google Map functionality is now completely broken, and potentially other parts of the page are non-functional. This indicates the HTML code I generated, despite attempts at care, contained significant errors or omissions that broke existing functionality.

Files Involved & Assumed State:

Star_Map_Generator.html: Currently contains the broken code I provided at 8:06 PM. Needs urgent debugging/reverting.
css/image-options.css: Correctly marked as obsolete.
js/color-picker.js: Contains the full reconstructed CSSScript picker logic with viewport positioning fixes.
js/picker_init.js: Contains the initialization logic for the CSSScript picker.
css/color-picker.css: Contains the reconstructed styles for the CSSScript picker panel.
Other JS/CSS files (main_app.js, map.js, general.css, etc.) are assumed to be in their last known good state before the final failed HTML update.
Immediate Next Steps for Next Session:

Diagnose HTML: Carefully read the current broken Star_Map_Generator.html. Compare it meticulously against the last known good version (Star_Map_Generator_PREVIOUS_2.html provided by the user) to identify exactly what changes I introduced in the last code block that broke the map and potentially other elements. Look for missing divs, incorrect nesting, script tag issues, or errors in the modified <style> block.
Generate Corrected HTML: Once the error is found, generate the complete, raw HTML code again, fixing the identified issue while still implementing the desired layout and container styling from the latest mockup. Extreme caution is required here due to previous failures.
Provide HTML for Manual Update: Present the corrected HTML code for the user to manually apply.
Verify Fix: After CMU, confirm the map functionality is restored AND the layout/styling issues are resolved.
Proceed with JS Tasks: If successful, move on to the JavaScript tasks (Image Format logic, Save/Load, History).
Apology: Acknowledge the significant failures and express commitment to a more careful, step-by-step debugging process focused on restoring functionality before adding new features.
