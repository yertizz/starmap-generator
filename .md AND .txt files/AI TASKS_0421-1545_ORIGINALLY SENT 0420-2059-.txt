AI TASKS_0421-1545 (SENT 0420-2059-SATURDAY) *** !!! MEANS "COMPLETED SUCCESSFULY"
===========================================
*** UPDATED 04212025-17:55 



































================================================================================================================================================
!!! A. ADD THE STARMAP STYLE, CIRCLE RAIUS, BORDER WIDTH AND BORDER COLOR TO THE SAVE AND LOAD HISTORY SETTINGS

!!! B. THE 3 CUSTOMIZABLE TEXT ENTRIES AND THE DATE AND LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE COORDINATES ARE NOT BEING COPIED/GHOSTED INTO THE TEXT ENTRIES IN THE FIELDSET ORDER SECTION. DO THIS.

!!! C. ADD THE VALUES/SETTINGS OF THE "Text Placements On Canvas" SECTION EACH ONE TO THE HISTORY AND SAVE AND LOAD FUNCTIONS NAMELY: - SEE b ABOVE - ADD THE ORDER, ABOVE, AND BELOW MAP SETTINGS TO THE HISTORY AND LOAD AND SAVE FUNCTIONS

!!! D. DEFAULT THE %AGE CIRCLE RADIUS TO 60%

!!! E. MAKE SCROLLER AND DECORATIVE ARROWS SLIGHTLY LARGER SO YOU CAN DISCRIMINATE AND CLICK ON WITH EASE. THEY ARE TOO SMALL RIGHT NOW.

F. ON LOADNG THE PAGE, I HAVE TO "HARD" REFRESSH THE PAGE "3" TIMES "EVERY" TIME THE PAGE IS HARD REFRESHED BEFORE THE GOOGLE MAP SHOWS. INVESTIGATE THIS AS THERE ARE ALSO WARNINGS IN ALL THE LOGS I HAVE BEEN SENDING YOU.

G. THE STAR MAP IMAGE TAKES 15-20 SECONDS TO LOAD AND SOMETIMES IT TIMES OUT WITH AN END POINT NOT RECEIVED? INVESTIGATE

H: Deferred (Elliptical image content):
VERY GOOD. NOW I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU ARE AT!

!!! WRT TASK B: I RESPONDED EARLIER BUT AGAIN HERE:
SST#1 - NOTE THE DATE "Day" IS STILL AT "underfined"!  ALSO IN STAR MAP CANVAS - SAME SST#2

*NEW:  ***ADD TO YOUR LIST OF TASKS AFTER F AND G: SEE BELOW NEW TASK H:

TASK H:
THE STAR IMAGE IS STILL ELLIPTAL IN ITS SEMI-MAJOR AXIS... I AM A GEODESCIST  SO I KNOW THE SCIENCE OF EARTH'S SHAPE. IT IS AN OBLATE SPHEROID WITH A SEMI=MAJOR (EAST WEST) AND SEMI MINOR (NORTH SOUTH AXIS)

*** DEFINITION OF THE WGS84 REFERENCE RLLIPSOID (USE BY THE GLOBAL POSITOINING SYSTEM ABD THE USA MILITARY AND CIVILIANS ALIKE WORLD WIDE - NAMELY THE GPS POSITIONING SYSTEMS/DEVICES):

READ: Description
E = wgs84Ellipsoid creates a referenceEllipsoid object for the World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS84) reference ellipsoid. By default, the lengths of the semimajor axis and semiminor axis are in meters.

Example: 
E = wgs84Ellipsoid(lengthUnit) creates a WGS84 reference ellipsoid with the length unit specified by lengthUnit.

THIS MAY ASSIST YOU IN YOUR MATH OF OBTAINING THE CORRECT ECCENTRICITY OR "FLATTENING' RAIO OF THE EARTH BU SCIENCE

GENERATING SMAL CIRCLES - EXAMPLES:
https://www.mathworks.com/help/map/generate-small-circles.html 
EG: Generate Small Circles
A small circle is the intersection of a plane with the surface of a sphere, such as a parallel of latitude on a spherical representation of the Earth. You can generate a small circle from the center point and a point on the perimeter by using the scircle2 function. You can generate a small circle from the center point and the arc length of the radius by using the scircle1 function.

For this example, create a small circle that surrounds Norway, Sweden, and Finland by using the scircle2 function and then create an identical small circle by using the scircle1 function.

First, specify the coordinates of a center point and a point along the perimeter. Find the coordinates of 100 points that make up the small circle by using the scircle2 function.


CONTENTS:
wgs84 = wgs84Ellipsoid
wgs84 = referenceEllipsoid with defining properties:

Name: 'WGS 84'
LengthUnit: 'meter'
SemimajorAxis: 6378137
SemiminorAxis: 6356752.31424518
InverseFlattening: 298.257223563
Eccentricity: 0.0818191908426215.

This is used to model the Earth's shape in many 99.99999% OF ALL Geodetic applications!!!! 

SST #3 -

ACKNOWLEDGE:

I: HISTORY TO BE WRITTEN TO A FILE IN NEW "HISTORY" FOLDER


TASK J:
INCREASE LENGTH OF ZOOM SLIDER TO TWICE ITS CURRENT "WIDTH" TO INCREASE USER GRANULARITY IN CHOOSING ZOOM LEVEL.

TASK K: ADVANCED STAR MAP FEATURES CAPABILITY WITH THE CURRENT STAR MAP API?
INVESTIGATES WHAT ADVANCED OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE FOR TH USER TO ENHANCE THE AESTHETICS OR FEATURES DISPLAY IN THE STAR MAP IMGAE AND ENSURE THE "ADVANCED OPTIONS" FIELDSET IS MODIFIED TO ACCOMODATE THE NECESSARY UI.

TASK L: STAR MAP CANVAS TEXT PLACEMENTS:
a. DATE AND COORDINATES MISSING FROM THEXT MAP.
b. IDENTIFY EXACTLKY :""WHERE" VERTICALLY, THE TEXT ENTRY PLACEMENT LINES 1,2,3 AND DATE AND COORDINATES GET PLACED ON THE CANVAS. WE HAVE DEFINED THIER ORDER NOW WE HAVE TO LOGICALLY PLACE THEM ON THE CANVAS AND BE MINDFUL OF THE CIRCLE RADIUS IN THAT A SETTING OF 100% WILL ALLOW THE TEXT PLACEMENTS TO LIE ON TOP OF THE IMAGE??? MAYBE OUR 100% SETTING SHOULD BE OF AN AGREED UPON LIMIT OF SAY 80% OF WHATEVER THE CANVAS SIZE IS?? COMMENTS?

TASK M:
ADD ANOTHER:
a. ADD AN EXTRA TEXT-PLACEMENT ROW FOR "PLACE": e.g., SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA USA - ASK FOR ADVICE... NEEDS TO GO ON CANVAS - SHOULD THIS ALSO BE ADDED AS A 4TH CUSTOMIZABLE ENTRY IN CONTAINER #1?

			b. CUSTOMIZABLE TEXT ENTRY ROW FOR "PLACE"
