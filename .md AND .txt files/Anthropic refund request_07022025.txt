Task Completed

__Don't worry! If you can't find a Session ID, you can still submit the refund request without it.__

__HERE'S WHAT TO DO:__

## __SUBMIT WITHOUT SESSION ID__

You can submit the refund request with the following information instead:

1. __Date and Time:__ July 2, 2025, 5:00 PM - 7:30 PM EST
2. __Your Account Email:__ The email you use to log into Claude
3. __Description:__ "Refund request for session that caused application damage"
4. __Reference:__ "Star Map Generator project - dropdown functionality implementation"

## __ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO IDENTIFY THE SESSION:__

1. __Browser History:__ Check your browser history for Claude.ai visits today
2. __Email Notifications:__ Check if you received any emails from Anthropic about usage
3. __Account Dashboard:__ Log into your Claude account and check for usage/billing information

## __WHAT ANTHROPIC SUPPORT CAN DO:__

Anthropic support can identify your session using:

- Your account email
- The date/time range (July 2, 2025, 5:00-7:30 PM EST)
- The specific technical issues described in the refund request

## __JUST SUBMIT AS-IS:__

The refund request document contains enough detail for Anthropic to:

- Identify the problematic session
- Verify the technical damage described
- Process your refund request

__Send the refund request to support@anthropic.com with the subject line "Refund Request - Session Damage - July 2, 2025" and attach the markdown file. They can locate your session from your account and the timestamp.__

The technical evidence and my acknowledgment of fault are the most important parts - the Session ID is just a convenience identifier.
