# Star Map Generator Project Breadcrumb Trail

This document serves as a detailed record of the work done on the Star Map Generator project. If you need to resume work with a new assistant, this will help them quickly understand what has been done and what still needs to be completed.

## Project Overview

The Star Map Generator is a web application that allows users to create custom star maps based on specific dates and locations. The application includes:

1. A user authentication system using Firebase
2. A history system for storing user inputs
3. A map interface for selecting locations
4. A star map generation system
5. Various customization options for the star map

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Firebase Authentication

- Implemented user registration and login functionality
- Added email verification
- Integrated Firebase Authentication with the main application
- Fixed issues with user account creation

### 2. History System

- Created the `history` directory and `history/data` subdirectory to store history data
- Created `history_manager.php` to handle storing and retrieving history data
- Added extensive error logging to diagnose issues
- Enhanced the history.js file with detailed debugging logs
- Created test files to verify the history system:
  - `history/test_history.php`: A PHP test script
  - `history_manual_test.html`: A browser-based test tool

## Current Status

The history system has been fixed and should now be working correctly. The history data is stored in JSON files on the server in the history/data directory, and user-specific history is maintained by prefixing storage keys with the user's Firebase ID.

## Pending Tasks

1. Test the history system to ensure it's working correctly
2. Implement any additional modifications requested by the user

## File Structure

Key files in the project:

- `Star_Map_Generator.html`: The main application file
- `login.html`: The login and registration page
- `js/history.js`: JavaScript code for the history system
- `history/history_manager.php`: PHP script for storing and retrieving history data
- `history/data/`: Directory where history data is stored
- `js/map.js`: JavaScript code for the map interface
- `css/coordinate-fields.css`: CSS for the coordinate input fields

## How to Resume Work

If you need to resume work with a new assistant, follow these steps:

1. Share this breadcrumb trail document with them
2. Explain what you were working on when the connection was lost
3. Provide any error messages or issues you encountered
4. Share the current state of the project (what's working and what's not)

## Debugging Tips

If you encounter issues with the history system:

1. Check the PHP error log at `history/php_errorlog` for server-side errors
2. Check the browser console for client-side errors
3. Use the test files (`history/test_history.php` and `history_manual_test.html`) to diagnose issues
4. Verify that the `history/data` directory exists and is writable
