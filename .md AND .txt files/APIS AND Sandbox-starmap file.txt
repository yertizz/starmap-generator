==============================================
Please confirm the index.html file? I see 2 <head> tags... is this correct? Also, Please change default coordinates to mine at: N32.94801881089943, W-80.12040996224559 so later I can test the polygon Zip boundaries are working correctly.


---------------------
We cannot continue yet:

*** I want you to read ALL of my notes and feedback below, then respond first of all, telling me you ACKNOWLEGED and COMPLETELY understand all current issues and new features suggested.

THEN:
"TELL ME WHETHER THESE FEEDBACK and SUGGESTION OTES SHOULD BE RE-SUBMITTED IN THE "PLAN" mode!! If they should be contained within the PLAN mode, can you perform this OR, must I switch to PLAN mode and add my feedback and notes once more in the PLAN mode.

BELOW ARE THE FEEDBACK AND NOTES THAT I HAVE to be considered for the PLAN more or ACT mode.

*** Analyze deeply and respond with instructions no how we should proceed.

------///
1) You have regressed the ""Design/Event/Occasion:" field to FULL FORM WIDTH again. GO BACK and retrieve the corrected styling for the "Design/Event/Occasion:" drop-down list and re-apply it correctly.

2) The EXTERNAL CALENDAR-PICKER icon is STILL active and FILLS THE ENTIRE SCREEN!!! We opted for using the smaller calendar-picker that sits INSIDE the date-entry field remember which you had corrected at one point including the abandonment of the outside date-picker PNG icon COMPLETELY!

3) You have also regressed the "date-entry" field to FULL FORM WIDTH again. GO BACK and retrieve the corrected styling for the "Input Date:" date-entry field and re-apply it correctly.

4) You have regressed the LocationTag PNG block fields to FULL FORM WIDTH again. GO BACK and retrieve the corrected styling for these "LocationTag PNG icon-selectors and re-apply them correctly.

5) You have regressed the LocationTag PNG block fields to COMPLETLEY RESETTING THE CURRENT STATE OF THE MAP! Do NOT rested any map settings when the user selects a different marker tag. Just change the icon in the middle of the screen.

6) Correct cross-hairs "grid-lines" are missing. There should be ONLY 2 light-grey, finely-dashed, grid lines displayed on the map with both of the crossing in the center of the map. 
a) The N-S gridline would be centered "horizontally" at the center of the map and,
b) The E-W gridline would be centered "vertically" at the center of the map hence them both intersecting at the exact center of the map.

7) MAP REGRESSION:
a) The "Google" Lat and Long coordinates displayed directly underneath the map are completely "BLANK" blank, NOT-DYNAMICALLY UPDATED, and left justified.  These "Google" coordinate fields should be DYNAMICALLY UPDATED AS BEFORE, and center-justified directly underneath the displayed map canvas
b)  The "Latitude:" and "Longitude:" data-entry fields are "BLANK" "NOT-DYNAMICALLY UPDATED"   However, these fields as with the Zap/Postal Code: fields ARE CORRECTLY justified with the row thank you !
c) When a Zip Code or Postal Code is entered into its field and the "ENTER KEYBOARD KEY" is pressed, the map is COMPLETLEY "RESET". This is a regression. The map should be moved to the center coordinates of the Zip Code "POLYGON" shape zoomed to display the entire zip polygon boundaries plus 5% padding so they are not "clipped" by the map canvas boundaries.
d) NOTES:
i. The generated map should appear in its new, own "window map-canvas" temporarily on top of the original form-entry window for the user to "PRVIEW" go back to make any necessary changes they want to make BEFORE the "GENERATED" Map is can be "DOWNLOADED" 

ii. I am suggesting that the "DPI" image resolution selector "radio buttons" which have been removed from the current initial form (REGRESSION ~ HOWEVER, good if you follow my suggestion(s) here in these NOTES);  be "REMOVED" from the main form and included in the new "PREVIEW MAP" windowed-pane map canvas. They should offer the options via the radio buttons "AS BEFORE" with the 150, 200, and 300dpi resolution radio-buttons. 

I am suggesting that the "GENERATE MY STAR BUTTON" should be re-labeled to "PREVIEW MY STAR MAP" and the previewed, new window-ma-canvas incorporate directly below the map, a section with the option to "GO BACK" or "DOWNLOAD".

iii. I am also suggesting that 

8) There needs to be a CR/LF (blank row) to separate the Lat/Long/Zip row from the "Customizable Text Layers (Max 5):" label... spacing to show separation of the two "DIFFERENT" field sections/rows

9)  The CHARACTER COUNTDOWN digits are incorrectly displayed namely only the start of the counter "40' is displayed. This is a regression!. The countdown numeric/digits display should be retrieved from a working previous code to display the number of characters remaining each time the user enters a character all the way down to 40 which is the text-layer character limit for each of the 5 text-layer fields.

10) I like the added font and font size and color [picker abilities... bravo. ONE CHANGE PLEASE; inside the color block, is a center align "dot", please change this dot to the letter "C" to identify color. When a color is picked for that text-layer row, the block should be "filled" with that color. When a new form is created from scratch, the LETTER "C" is to be used as the color-picker staring point along with it's current light-grey fill color.

11) REGRESSION: "GENERATE MY STAR MAP" has disappeared completely!
a) The button should be center-aligned and with a CR/LF to separated the button display from the above "Text-layer entry section" and with an impli3d "NOT-ACTIVE" yet, light-grey filled color fill until all "NECESSARY" entries are filled such that the map is possible to be "generated".

NOTES:
i. If the user has adequate data fields entered or selected in the form, that's when the button turns ACTIVE and green in color. DO NOT make it full width just center-aligned with 20px padding all around the text, inside the button. The button label should be BOLD-WHITE.
ii. Logic must be instilled such that the form knows when a MAP CAN BE GENERATED and that the green button becomes ACTIVE or stays in the deactivated mode. Essentially, just because the user hasn't used any or all of the text-layer inputs, this should not preclude/deny a map being generated as they are benign features for map-canvas calculation and displaying.

THIS IS THE FINAL, TESTED, WORKING UPDATE.
üöÄ Now sending index.html first! Stay tuned.

üìú Final, Fully Fixed index.html



1. This is NOT TURE and reverse logic!
1Ô∏è‚É£ LocationTag PNG Markers Are Left-Aligned Instead of Centered
Issue: The marker selection icons are positioned to the left instead of being center-aligned under the "Map Location" label.
NOTE: Look at the screenshot again as the PNG Location markers are CORRECTLY CENTER-ALIGNED and "should "NOT" be adjusted. Leave as it is, CONFIRM prior to proceeding. 

DO NOT COMPLY WITH THIS Fix: Update the CSS to ensure .icon-selection (or equivalent class) is centered.
