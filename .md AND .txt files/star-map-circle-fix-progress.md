# Star Map Circle Fix Progress

## Current Status (May 28, 2025)

### Accomplishments

1. **Fixed Circle Rendering Issue**
   - Created `circle-fix-direct.js` to ensure canvas dimensions match the width and height input fields
   - Successfully fixed the issue with circles appearing as ellipses in all views
   - Canvas now maintains proper aspect ratio

2. **Added Dimension Label**
   - Added a label above the canvas showing the dimensions
   - Implemented different formats for paper size selection vs. manual entry
   - Used lowercase "w" and "h" for width and height

### Remaining Issues

1. **Dimension Label Format**
   - The label format still needs adjustment (not working correctly)
   - Need to ensure proper "Paper" annotation when paper size is selected
   - Need to verify lowercase "w" and "h" are displayed correctly

2. **Canvas Display Issues**
   - Star maps and street maps are not displaying at the correct size
   - In the combined views (landscape and portrait), the Google Map appears briefly and then disappears
   - Need to investigate why the maps are not displaying correctly

## Plan for Tomorrow (May 29, 2025)

1. **Fix Dimension Label**
   - Debug why the label format is not working correctly
   - Ensure proper display for both paper size selection and manual entry
   - Verify the label updates correctly when dimensions change

2. **Address Canvas Display Issues**
   - Investigate why the star maps and street maps are not displaying correctly
   - Fix the issue with Google Maps disappearing in combined views
   - Ensure all maps display at the correct size and maintain their aspect ratio

3. **Test All Views**
   - Star Map view
   - Street Map view
   - Canvas Layout view
   - Combined (Landscape) view
   - Combined (Portrait) view

## Implementation Details

### Current Dimension Label Format

1. For paper size selection:
   ```
   CANVAS DIMENSIONS: Paper [paper size] Size: (@[dpi] DPI): [width]w x [height]h
   ```

2. For manually entered dimensions:
   ```
   CANVAS DIMENSIONS: Size: [width]w x [height]h
   ```

### Key Files Modified

- `js/circle-fix-direct.js` - Main fix for circle rendering and dimension label
- `Star_Map_Generator.html` - Added script reference

### Next Steps

1. Debug dimension label issues
2. Fix canvas display issues
3. Test all views thoroughly
4. Document final solution
