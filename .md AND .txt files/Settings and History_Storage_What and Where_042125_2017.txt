Why Two Folders (settings/ and history/)?

Different Data Types: The "Settings" represent a single snapshot of the entire form configuration at a point in time. The "History" represents multiple, separate lists of past inputs for specific fields.
Separation of Concerns: Using separate folders and PHP handlers keeps the logic clean. settings_manager.php only deals with saving/loading the single settings object. history_manager.php deals with saving/loading multiple, distinct history arrays based on a provided key. This makes the code easier to manage and debug.
Data Structure: saved_settings.json contains one complex object. The files in history/data/ each contain a simple array of strings. Storing them separately reflects this structural difference.
File Listing Summary:

settings/ folder:
settings_manager.php: Handles saving/loading the main settings object.
saved_settings.json: Stores the single, comprehensive settings snapshot object.
history/ folder:
history_manager.php: Handles saving/loading individual history lists.
data/ (subdirectory): Contains the actual history data files:
zipCodeHistory.json: Array of past ZIP code entries.
history_text-entry-1.json: Array of past Text Entry 1 values.
history_text-entry-2.json: Array of past Text Entry 2 values.
history_text-entry-3.json: Array of past Text Entry 3 values.
history_text-entry-4.json: Array of past Text Entry 4 values.
