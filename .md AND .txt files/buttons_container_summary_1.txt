*** CAN WE ADDRESS MY NEXT ISSUE? I WOULD LIKE TO SUMMARIZE IT FIRST AND PROVIDE YOU A MOCKUP TO ILLUSTARE THE DESIRED OUTCOME.

REQUEST:
ONCE YOU HAVE DIGESTED WHAT I HAVE SUMMARIZED HERE AND HAVE FORMED YOUR OPINION ETC, AND WE HAVE AN AGREED PLAN TO GO FORWARD WITH WHATEVER WE EVENTUALLY AGREE UPON, I WOULD LIKE THIS ADDED TO THE .md FILE TO UPDATE THE MOST RECENT TASK/CODING EFFORT OF THE "SETTINGS - PREVIEW AND DOWNLOAD" CONTAINER:
*** NOTE, THE "LOAD SETTINGS", "SAVE SETTINGS", WORK PERFECTLY AS DOES THE "VIEW STAR MAP ON CANVAS" FUNCTION, AND THE "DOWNLOAD STAR MAP WITH CANVAS LAYOUT" FUNCTIONS (THEY MAY OBVIOUSLY BE CALLED SOMETHING ELSE IN THE CURRENT WORKING FILES/CODE... BUT THEY DO WORK!!!)


SUMMARY OF NEXT ISSUE:
=====================
BUTTONS CONTAINER:
NOTE: IN THE CURRNET /starmap/ PROJECT THE BUTTONS HAVE COLLAPSED OR NOT BEEN CAUGHT IN THEIR OWN CONTAINER (AGAIN I JUST HAVENT ADDRESSED IT AS A PRIORITY) - HOWEVER, THOSE THAT ARE THERE, *** DO *** FUNCTION!! TAKE NOTE OF THIS PLEASE AS PER ABOVE EVEN THOUGH WE MAY CHANGE OUT THE BUTTONS STYLING - READ ON PLEASE:

a. SST# 1 IS FROM THE CURRENT /starmap PROJECT.
b. There are going to be "12' BUTTONS IN ALL WHEN WE'RE DONE!! 5 ARE PRESENT AND FUNCTIONING BUT NOT IN THEIR STYLIZED CONTAINER STYLING LIKE THE OTHER CONTAINERS.
*** ADDITIONAL BUTTONS WILL BE ADDED AT THIS STAGE AT ONCE OR INCREMENTALLY AS YOU SEE FIT AS WELL AS SOME RESTYLING OF THE CURRENT BUTTON'S COLOR/SIZES AND LABELS. READ ON:

2. THE BUTTONS CONTAINER WILL BE LEGENDED/TITLED AS AS: "Settings + Preview + Download Section" (*** USE SAME COLOR AS OTHER CONAINERS LEGENDS USE).

BUTTONS:
1. LOAD SETTINGS (SEE BLUE COLOR #1D99EF)
2. SAVE SETTINGS (SEE ALSO BLUE COLOR #1D99EF)

*** SEE MOCKUP AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE GOAL... I AM SURE YOU WILL HAVE MUCH SIMPLER WAYS TO ACHIEVE MY MOCKUP INTENTION AND MAINTAIN THE CURRENT PAGE'S AESTHETICS AND STYLING... I MAY HAVE GONE OVERBOARD ON COLORS FOR INSTANCE !!!!!! ~~~ I VALUE YOUR OPINION ON THIS MATTER AND AM ALL YEARS FOR A "LESS FLAMBOYANT AND "LOUD" MOCKUP!!! ~~~ RSVP!


GOAL/PREMISE:
ALLOW THE USER TO PERFORM #1 THRU 12 ABOVE. 1,2,5, AND 8 ALL CURRENTLY HAVE FUNCTIONS IN PLACE THAT WORK AND BEEN THOROUGHLY TESTED.


A. DOWNLOADING THE STREET MAP:
I WANT THE USER TO BE ABLE TO VIEW AND IF DESIRED ALSO DOWNLOAD THE GOOGLE STREET MAP ITSELF INSIDE THE SAME SIZE CIRCLE-RADIUS (AS SET IN FOR THE STAR MAP USING THE SAME ATTRIBUTES AS THE STAR MAP RADII NAMELY SIZE, BG COLOR ET AL ~ SO THE GOOGLE STREET MAP CURRENTLY DISPLAYED WOULD APPEAR INSIDE THE CIRCLE AS OPPOSED TO THE STAR MAP VIA THE STAR MAP API. WE WILL LIKELY NEED SAME CIRCLE SNIPPING I BELIEVE??
COMMENTS PLEASE?


B. DOWNLOADING STAR MAP
I WANT THE USER TO BE ABLE TO DOWNLOAD THE STAR MAP AND THE GOOGLE MAP CIRCLES SIDE BY SIDE [LANDSCAPE] AND [PORTRAIT] AND SLIGHTLY OVERLAPPING (MAY NEED ITERATIVE TWEAKING TO GET THIS CORRECT BUT MUSTY BE MIONDFUL OF THE CANVAS SIZE SETTINGS AND ASPECT RATIO SETTINGS ETC.
*** MAYBE AN OVERLAP AMOUNT IN PIXELS... THEY WILL NEED TO TWEAK THIS THEMSELVES TO FIND THE BEST RESULTS BY PREVIEWING BEFORE DOWNLOADING?? COMMENTS PLEASE?

SEE SST #2

QUESTIONS:
A. THE BUTTONS ARE DOABLE SO THAT I AM NOT CONCERNED ABOUT AS WE HAVE ALREADY DONE THIS IN A PREVIOUS PROJECT AND LIKE I STATED, 1,2,3 AND 5 HAVE CODE/FUNCTIONS THAT CURRENTLY WORK 100%.

B. IS THIS GOOGLE MAP ON IT'S OWN AND THE DOUBLE MAP EG. MAP AND STAR-MAP COMBO DOABLE ~ LADSACAPE AND PORTRAIT WITH THE ENTRIES PLACE EITHER SIDE VIA OUR CUREENT RADIO BUTTON TOP/BOTTOM (LEFT/RIGHT) AND FIRST, SECOND, THIRD ETC ETC? SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT THIS INTUITIVELY WOULD BE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. I AM UNSURE!!

****** PLEASE READ AND DEEPLY ANALYZE MY DIATRIBE HERE AND RESPOND WITH YOUR UNDERSTANDING AND MOREVER, HOPEFULLY BETTER SUGGESTIONS ON HOW WE CAN IMPLEMENT THIS FNCTIONALITY IN A SIMPLER WAY THAN PERHAPS MY "SNAZZY" MOCKUP WHICH, TO BE HONEST, LOOKS TOO "LOUD" BUT IT SHOULD AT LEAST ILLUSTRATE TO YOU WHAT I AM TRYING TO ACHIEVE.

ACKOWLEDGE PLEASE.
