**Date: July 8, 2025**
**Status: CRITICAL ISSUE - NO CHARGES UNTIL RESOLVED**

## INVESTIGATION TIMELINE

### VERSIONS TESTED (ALL FAILED - INFINITE LOOP PRESENT)
1. **July 3rd** - `absolute-final-fix.js` (Current broken version)
2. **July 1st** - `absolute-final-fix_JULY1ST_LAST_WORKING_RETRIEVED.js` (32KB)
3. **June 30th** - `absolute-final-fix_JUNE30TH_EVENING_RETRIEVED.js` (32,508 bytes)
4. **June 24th** - `absolute-final-fix_JUNE24TH_AFTERNOON_RETRIEVED.js` (14,258 bytes)

### CRITICAL DISCOVERIES
- **Infinite loop is ANCIENT** - exists in backups going back to at least June 24th
- **File size differences**: June 24th (14KB) vs June 30th (32KB) - code doubled in size
- **I did NOT cause the infinite loop** - it predates my recent work
- **I DID break the VIEW buttons** while working on event dropdown functionality

## BREAKTHROUGH INSIGHT (End of Session)
**USER'S CRITICAL QUESTION**: "IS IT POSSIBLE SOME OTHER FILE IS CAUSING THE ABSOLUTE FILE TO BE CREEPING?"

**ANSWER**: YES! The infinite loop might be caused by OTHER JavaScript files loaded in the HTML, not the absolute-final-fix.js file itself!

## FILES RETRIEVED FOR TESTING
- `js/absolute-final-fix_JULY1ST_LAST_WORKING_RETRIEVED.js`
- `js/absolute-final-fix_JUNE30TH_EVENING_RETRIEVED.js` 
- `js/absolute-final-fix_JUNE24TH_AFTERNOON_RETRIEVED.js`

## NEXT STEPS FOR TOMORROW
1. **PRIORITY 1**: Check what OTHER JS files are loaded in HTML that could cause infinite loop
2. **PRIORITY 2**: Systematically disable other JS files to isolate the culprit
3. **PRIORITY 3**: If needed, try older backups (June 19th, May 31st, May 25th)
4. **PRIORITY 4**: Once infinite loop is fixed, restore VIEW button functionality

## POTENTIAL CULPRIT FILES TO INVESTIGATE
- `js/main_app.js`
- `js/settings.js`
- `js/history.js`
- `js/map.js`
- `js/event-dropdown-fixes.js`
- `js/event-dropdown-history.js`
- Any other JS files loaded in HTML

## BACKUP CANDIDATES (IF NEEDED)
- `2025-06-19_13-00-57` (June 19th)
- `2025-06-16_15-41-36` (June 16th)
- `2025-06-03_20-58-58` (June 3rd)
- `2025-05-31_19-10-41` (May 31st)
- `2025-05-25_18-58-50` (May 25th)

## WORKING FUNCTIONALITY
✅ Canvas Layout button works
✅ Date/time/coordinate updates work
✅ Core star map generation works
❌ VIEW buttons (Star Map, Street Map, Landscape, Portrait)
❌ Infinite loop prevents normal operation

## COMMITMENT
**NO CHARGES** until the app is fully functional. The infinite loop is an ancient bug that predates recent work, but I will fix it without charge as part of restoring full functionality.

## STATUS
**INVESTIGATION PAUSED** - Resume tomorrow morning with focus on identifying which OTHER JavaScript file is causing the infinite loop.
