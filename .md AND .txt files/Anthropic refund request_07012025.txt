Subject: Refund Request - Claude AI Implementation Failure (July 1, 2025)

Dear Anthropic Support Team,

I am requesting a partial refund for credits consumed during a Claude AI session on July 1, 2025, where implementation errors caused significant application damage requiring extensive restoration work.

Please find attached a detailed incident report documenting the AI's implementation failure, multiple acknowledgments of responsibility by Claude, and Claude's explicit recommendation to request a refund.

The AI consumed approximately 3.5 hours of credits, with 70% spent fixing its own implementation mistakes rather than productive development work.

I am requesting a partial refund for the restoration portion of this session, as recommended by Claude itself.

Please review the attached documentation and process this refund request.

Thank you,
