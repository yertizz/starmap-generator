**Incident Reference:** Claude AI Event Dropdown Implementation Failure

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

I am formally requesting a refund for credits consumed during a Claude AI session on July 1, 2025, where the AI's implementation caused significant application damage requiring extensive restoration work. The AI has acknowledged responsibility for these implementation errors and recommended that I contact Anthropic support for a refund.

## INCIDENT DETAILS

### Background
- **Project:** Star Map Generator web application
- **Task Requested:** Implement Event dropdown functionality
- **Expected Outcome:** Working dropdown similar to existing Address/Zip dropdowns
- **Actual Outcome:** Complete application layout failure

### What Went Wrong
1. **AI Implementation Error:** Claude implemented an Event dropdown that fundamentally broke the application's container positioning
2. **Layout Destruction:** All main application containers (Map Location, Text Layers, Canvas Settings, etc.) were displaced outside the main form structure
3. **Backup Restoration Required:** Multiple attempts to restore from backups were needed
4. **Wrong Backup Used:** AI initially restored from an incorrect backup, making the problem worse

### Time and Credits Consumed
- **Session Duration:** Approximately 3.5 hours (9:00 AM - 12:20 PM EST)
- **Work Type:** 
  - 30% Initial implementation (legitimate work)
  - 70% Restoration and debugging (fixing AI's mistakes)

### AI's Acknowledgment of Responsibility
The AI explicitly stated multiple times:
- "NO MORE CHARGES - THIS IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO FIX"
- "I SHOULD NOT BE CHARGING YOU FOR THIS"
- "This was my responsibility to fix at no charge to you"
- "You should not be charged for restoration work"

## RESOLUTION ACHIEVED

The issue was ultimately resolved when I provided a working backup file I had intelligently saved as `Star_Map_Generator_1.html`. The AI's restoration attempts had failed because it was using incorrect backup sources.

## REFUND JUSTIFICATION

1. **AI Acknowledged Fault:** Claude explicitly acknowledged the implementation errors were its responsibility
2. **Non-Productive Work:** 70% of the session was spent fixing AI-caused problems, not developing new features
3. **User's Preparation Saved Project:** My backup strategy, not the AI's work, ultimately resolved the crisis
4. **AI Recommended Refund:** Claude specifically recommended I contact Anthropic for a refund

## REQUESTED ACTION

I request a **partial refund** for the credits consumed during the restoration portion of this session (approximately 70% of total credits used). The initial implementation attempt was legitimate work, but the extensive restoration required due to AI errors should not be charged to the user.

## SUPPORTING EVIDENCE

This entire conversation thread serves as evidence of:
- The AI's implementation failure
- Multiple acknowledgments of responsibility
- Extensive restoration work required
- AI's explicit recommendation to request a refund

**Note:** This incident highlights the importance of having refund policies for cases where AI implementation errors require extensive restoration work. The user should not bear the cost of fixing AI mistakes.
