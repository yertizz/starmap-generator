I HAVE UNCOVERED SOME OTHER OR NEW ISSUES ON SOME DATA CONTAINERS (MISSING ITEMS, ITEMS NOT RETAINED OR SAVED ETC). WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS LATER AND ONCE WE HAVE THE "VIEW BUTTONS" CALCULATIONS FIXED AND - ZOOM SLIDER INTERACTIVITY FIXED *BEFORE* I TURN BACK TO CONTAINER ISSUES.
UNDERSTOOD?

THIS IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN BUT HERE GOES.

SUMMARY:
A. WHEN THE PAGE IS LOADED FROM SCRATCH, AND DATE AND COORDINATES ARE SET, THE "FIRST" TIME I USE THE "STARMAP" *OR* STREET VIEW BUTTONS, IT DOSAYS ACCORDING TO THE PLAN AND CORRECTLY i.e. IT WORKS!:
SETTINGS WERE:
DIMS: 2550 X 3300
DPI: 3O0

COMBINED VIEW OPTIONS:
CIRCLE OVERLAP: 30%
MAP ORDER: STREET MAP FIRST

STAR MAP IMAGE SETTINGS:
MAP STLE: Default
RADIUS: 60%
BORDER: 10(px)
BGCOLOR: HEX #FFA500


PROCESS 1:
A.THE "VIEW STAR MAP" TAKES A LONG TIME TO LOAD THE IMAGE BUT THATS THE API I AM SURE. BUT WHEN IT LOADS, IT DISPLAYS CORRECTLY.
B.THE "VIEW STREET MAP" DISPLAYS INSTANTANEOUSLY AND CORRECTLY.
C. NOW HOWEVER, WHEN USING THE "CANVAS LAYOUT" BUTTON:THE "VIEW STAR MAP" TAKES A LONG TIME TO LOAD THE IMAGE BUT THATS THE API I AM SURE. BUT WHEN IT LOADS, IT DISPLAYS CORRECTLY.

NOTE ISSUES:
1. ONCE THE CANVAS LAYOUT HAS WRECKED THE DISPLAY OF THE IMAGE AS PER C. ABOVE, THE "VIEW STAR MAP" AND "VIEW STREET MAP" IMAGES WITHOUT *ANY* CHANGES OF SEETINGS, BOTH FAIL CARRYING OVER THE EGG-SHAPED DISPLAY FROM CLOCKING THE "CANVAS LAYOUT" BUTTON!!

2. ALL VIEW BUTTONS FAIL TO DISPLAY CORECTLY AFTER CLICKING ON THE "CANVAS LAYPOUIT" BUTTIN - ITS LIKE IT WRECKS THE DISPLAY AND COPIES IT TO ALL THE OTHER BUTTONS!



PROCESS 2:
A. WHEN LOADING THE PAGE AGAIN WITH THE EXACT SAME SETTINGS, BUT THIS TIME, BY PASSING [STARMAP or STREET MAP or CANVAS LAYOUT BUTTONS", ON CLICKING THE COMBINED LANDSCAPE" OR THE "COMBINED PORTRAIT" BUTTONS, THERE OS A TOTAL RIDICULOUSLY APPLIED IMAGE FOR BOTH.
B. NOTE: ONCE CLIKCING ANY OF THE COMBINED BUTTONSM, THEN GOING BACK TO VIEW THE STAR MAP or STREET MAP or CANVAS LAYOUT VIEW BUTTONS, NONE DISPLAY PROPERLY AND ALL HAVE THE EGG-SHAPED BADLY OVERLAY TEXT ISSUES.


OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
A. WHEN USING THE ZOOM-SLIDER WHEN "ANY" OF THE VIW BUTTONS ARE USED, THE "DESTROYED CANVAS LAYOUT" IS DISPLAYED!!!

****
WE HAD THIS WORKING BEFORE BUT ALL THE WAY THROUGH!!

THERE IS CEALRY SOME INTERVENTION AND RETENTION OF POORLY DISPLAYED IMAGES POSSIBLE BEING INCORRECTLY "CALCUALYTED" BASED ON THE "VARIABLE SETTINGS PER ABOVE"... WHEN CHANGING THE SETTINGS, THE ALGORITH SHOUD CHECK AND ACCONT FOR ALL PARTICIPATING VARIABLES/PARAMETERS, TO PROPERLY DISPLAY THE IMAGES:

THIS IS GOING TO NEED A DEEP DIVE INTO THE ALGORTHM/IMAGE DISPLAY CALCULATIONS, CORRECTLY CHECKING AND USING THE CURRENT SETTINGS INVOLVED, CORRECTLY USING THE VIEW BUTTON STYLING FOR THAT BUTTON AND ALLOCATION OF VIEWS TO THOSE BUTTONS, AND EVEN POSSIBLY, THE ZOOM SLIDER PLAYING A SEPARATE PART THAT RESULTS IN HPRRIBLE OBFUSCATIONS "AFTER" THE IMAGE IS DISPLAYED?


**** I NEED YOU TO FOCUS ON THIS ISSE 100% OF YOUR TIME UNTIL WE HAVE RESOLEVED THES ISSUES.

FYI, I CREATED A FULL PROJECT BACKUP AT:
"C:\Users\phili\E-DRIVE\AnythingPOD\STAR-MAP-SOURCE_BACKUPS_050825\2025-05-28_13-29-22"
